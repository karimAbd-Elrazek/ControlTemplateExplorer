## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- Windows OS (WPF requirement)
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karimAbd-Elrazek/WPF-Control-Template-Explorer.git
   cd WPF-Control-Template-Explorer
   ```

2. **Build the application**
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

### Quick Start

1. Launch the application
2. Browse the list of WPF controls on the left panel
3. Use the search box to quickly find specific controls
4. Click on any control to view its template
5. Copy templates to clipboard or save to files for your projects

## 🛠️ How It Works

The application uses .NET reflection to:

1. **Scan Assemblies**: Examines the PresentationFramework.dll assembly
2. **Discover Controls**: Finds all public, concrete classes that inherit from Control
3. **Instantiate Controls**: Creates instances of controls to access their templates
4. **Extract Templates**: Uses XamlWriter to serialize ControlTemplate objects to XAML
5. **Format Output**: Provides clean, readable XAML with proper indentation
